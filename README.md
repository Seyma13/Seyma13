ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Åžeyma. While studying Computer Programming, my interest in the software field increased. When I graduated from the program I studied, I wanted to advance in this field.
ðŸ‘€ I try to develop sustainable projects and create user-friendly designs by writing simple, understandable, and functional code.
ðŸŒ± I love discovering and experimenting with new things while developing software.
âœ¨ I am currently working on the JavaScript language and its libraries.
I am developing projects with React.
ðŸ“« In team projects, I enjoy listening to new ideas and generating new ideas and solutions from different perspectives.
